# Basic example

This submodule deploys an Azure ExpressRoute Gateway in the Virtual Hub

```hcl
resource "azurerm_express_route_gateway" "express_route_gateway" {
  for_each = var.expressroute_gateways != null && length(var.expressroute_gateways) > 0 ? var.expressroute_gateways : {}

  location                      = each.value.location
  name                          = each.value.name
  resource_group_name           = each.value.resource_group_name
  scale_units                   = each.value.scale_units
  virtual_hub_id                = each.value.virtual_hub_id
  allow_non_virtual_wan_traffic = each.value.allow_non_virtual_wan_traffic
  tags                          = try(each.value.tags, {})
}
```

## Required Inputs

No required inputs.

## Optional Inputs

The following input variables are optional (have default values):

### <a name="input_expressroute_gateways"></a> [expressroute\_gateways](#input\_expressroute\_gateways)

Description:   
Map of objects for Express Route Gateways to deploy into the Virtual WAN Virtual Hubs that have been defined in the variable `virtual_hubs`.

The key is deliberately arbitrary to avoid issues with known after apply values. The value is an object, of which there can be multiple in the map:

- `name`: Name for the ExpressRoute Gateway to deploy in the Virtual WAN Virtual Hub.
- `virtual_hub_id`: The object ID of the virtual hub.
- `tags`: Optional tags to apply to the ExpressRoute Gateway resource.
- `allow_non_virtual_wan_traffic`: Optional boolean to configures this gateway to accept traffic from non Virtual WAN networks. Defaults to `false`.
- `scale_units`: Optional number of scale units for the ExpressRoute Gateway. Defaults to `1`. See: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-expressroute-about#expressroute-gateway-performance for more information on scale units.

> Note: There can be multiple objects in this map, one for each ExpressRoute Gateway you wish to deploy into the Virtual WAN Virtual Hubs that have been defined in the variable `virtual_hubs`.

Type:

```hcl
map(object({
    name                          = string
    virtual_hub_id                = string
    location                      = string
    resource_group_name           = string
    tags                          = optional(map(string))
    allow_non_virtual_wan_traffic = optional(bool, false)
    scale_units                   = optional(number, 1)
  }))
```

Default: `{}`

## Outputs

The following outputs are exported:

### <a name="output_resource"></a> [resource](#output\_resource)

Description: Azure ExpressRoute Gateway resource name

### <a name="output_resource_id"></a> [resource\_id](#output\_resource\_id)

Description: Azure ExpressRoute Gateway resource ID

### <a name="output_resource_object"></a> [resource\_object](#output\_resource\_object)

Description: Azure ExpressRoute Gateway resource object
